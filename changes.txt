1) No normalization of S_r in ACTION decomposition
2) Fixing unification for reproducibility (issue: network construction)
3) FW-Simplex regression
3) Fixing umap algorithm (https://github.com/LTLA/umappp) for reproducibility under parallel execution -- Issue: 
    parallelFor(0, max_elements, [&] (size_t j)
                { appr_alg->addPoint(X.colptr(j), static_cast<size_t>(j)); }, 1);
                
	The Eigen library for matrix operations.
	The irlba library for singular value decomposition (or in this case, an eigendecomposition).
	The knncolle library for nearest neighbor search. If you are instead supplying your own neighbor search, this dependency can be eliminated by defining the UMAPPP_CUSTOM_NEIGHBORS macro.
	The aarand library for random distribution functions.
