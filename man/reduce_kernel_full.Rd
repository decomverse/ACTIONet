\title{Computes reduced kernel matrix for a given (single-cell) profile}
\usage{
reduce_kernel_full(S, reduced_dim = 50L, iter = 5L, seed = 0L,
  reduction_algorithm = 1L, SVD_algorithm = 1L, prenormalize = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Input matrix ('matrix')}

\item{reduced_dim}{Dimension of the reduced kernel matrix (default=50)}

\item{seed}{Random seed (default=0)}

\item{reduction_algorithm}{Kernel reduction algorithm. Currently only ACTION method (1) is implemented (default=1)}

\item{SVD_algorithm}{SVD algorithm to use. Currently supported methods are Halko (1) and Feng (2) (default=1)}

\item{iters}{Number of SVD iterations (default=5)}
}
\value{
A named list with S_r, V, lambda, and exp_var. \itemize{
\item S_r: reduced kernel matrix of size reduced_dim x #samples.
\item V: Associated left singular-vectors (useful for reconstructing discriminative scores for features, such as genes).
\item lambda, exp_var: Summary statistics of the sigular-values.
