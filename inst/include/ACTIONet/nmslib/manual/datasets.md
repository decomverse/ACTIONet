## Data Sets

In the past, we have used several data sets, which were created either by other folks,
or using 3d party software. If you use these data sets, please, consider
giving proper credit. The download scripts prints respective BibTex entries.


Here is the list of scripts to download major data sets:
* Data sets for our NIPS'13 and SISAP'13 papers [data/get_data_nips2013.sh](/data/get_data_nips2013.sh).  
* Data sets for our VLDB'15 paper [data/get_data_vldb2015.sh](/data/get_data_vldb2015.sh).  

The downloaded data needs to be decompressed (you may need 7z, gzip, and bzip2)
